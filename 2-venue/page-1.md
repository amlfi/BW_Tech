# 2.1 / Overview

## Venue Introduction

The venue is composed of three distinct structures: Pavilion 1, Pavilion 2, and Pavilion 3. The venue's facade encloses the external back-of-house area. Pavilion 1 connects to Pavilion 2 through an internal tunnel. Pavilion 3 remains separate, for use by staff only.&#x20;

## Patron Experience&#x20;

üö™**Patron entrance to Bluey's World is via the exterior front deck.** The experience begins in **Pavilion 1**, where guests are split into two mirrored groups, each led by a gnome guide.&#x20;

‚è±Ô∏è Typically, sessions run every (10?) minutes.&#x20;

_Note:  on quieter days, only one side of the house is utilised keeping session groups together._ &#x20;

Guests journey through the house-themed environments, following the storyline in search of **Bluey and Bingo.**

In **Pavilion 1,** each group moves through:

**Mirrored houses (referred to as Riverside and MacArthur)**

* Living Room
* Cubby
* Bedroom

**The two groups then merge and continue through shared spaces:**

* Chattermax
* Playroom
* Kitchen
* Backyard
* Garden Shed (_exit point from Pavilion 1_)

Guests then pass through a tunnel into **Pavilion 2**, where they explore:

* The Creek
* The Dome

Guests are split again for the **Meet & Greet** Photo Op with Bluey and Bingo üêæ .

The experience concludes in the **Neighbourhood Zone**, a **non-guided** area featuring:

* Interactive playground
* Merch shop
* Caf√© and ice cream parlour
* Info Booth
* **Exit** back onto the exterior deck
