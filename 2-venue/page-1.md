# 2.1 / Overview

### Venue Patron Experience&#x20;

**Patron entrance to Bluey's World is via the exterior deck.** The experience begins in **Pavilion 1**, where guests are split into two mirrored groups, each led by a gnome guide. Typically, sessions run every (XX?) minutes. _Note, on quieter days, groups remain together through the entire house, using only one side._&#x20;

Guests journey through the house-themed environments, following the storyline in search of Bluey and Bingo.

**In Pavilion 1, each group moves through:**

**Mirrored houses (referred to as Riverside and MacArthur)**

* Living Room
* Cubby
* Bedroom

**The two groups then merge and continue through shared spaces:**

* Chattermax
* Playroom
* Kitchen
* Backyard
* Garden Shed (exit point from Pavilion 1)

Guests then pass through a tunnel into **Pavilion 2**, where they explore:

* The Creek
* The Dome

Guests are split again for the **Meet & Greet** Photo Op with Bluey and Bingo.

The experience concludes in the **Neighbourhood Zone**, a non-guided area featuring:

* Interactive playground
* Merch shop
* Café and ice cream parlour
* Info Booth
* **Exit** back onto the exterior deck
