# 6.3.6 / Maintenance

**🗓️ Daily**

* Confirm all show-critical devices are online before power-up.
* Check for alerts in network monitoring tools (e.g. UniFi, Dante Controller).
* Note any unusual slowdowns or disconnections.

***

**📆 Weekly**

* Verify patch points in racks and wall plates are secure and clearly labeled.
* Reboot any unmanaged switches or media converters showing degraded performance.
* Back up updated network configs (if changes have occurred).

***

**🗓️ Monthly**

* Inspect physical cabling in racks and visible runs—look for kinks, strain, or unsecured lengths.
* Confirm VLANs and IP addressing are consistent with documentation.
* Run a full Dante or network scan to catch offline or duplicated devices.

***

**📅 Quarterly**

* Apply firmware updates to managed switches and key networked devices (outside show hours).
* Review and update the network map if changes were made (new endpoints, removed gear, rerouting).
* Test redundant paths or failover setups if present (e.g. backup switches or fiber routes).
