# 6.7.4.1.3 / Shut Down

## 🔴 EXAMPLE: PLEASE UPDATE WITH ACTUAL PROCESS -MM

***

### 🎯 Purpose

To ensure all video playback systems are shut down cleanly, preventing data loss and ensuring settings are preserved for future use.

***

### 🧰 Pre-Shutdown Checks

* ✅ Confirm show has ended and projectors are still active
* ✅ Ensure no active media or layers are playing
* ✅ Notify relevant departments (if required) before system shutdown

***

### ⏹ Shut Down Steps

1. **Pause or stop all media layers** in Resolume
2. Close Resolume by clicking `File > Quit` or using the close window button
3. Wait for Resolume to fully close (it may take a few seconds)
4. Proceed to shut down **NestMap** (if open)
5. Once software is closed, shut down the **Dome PC** if appropriate

***

### ✅ Confirm

* No projector feeds are receiving content
* No Resolume-related processes are running (Task Manager if needed)
* All display outputs are idle or blacked out
* PC is either shut down or returned to desktop

***

### 📝 Notes

* Always shut down Resolume **before** powering off projectors or Dome PC
* If you encounter lag or freezing on shutdown, force-quit via Task Manager
