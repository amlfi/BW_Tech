# 6.7.4 / Software

## üíª Video Software

_A reference guide to the key software systems supporting video playback and projection across Bluey's World._

***

<details>

<summary>üéõÔ∏è Resolume</summary>

**Function**\
Media playback and video output control.

**Used For**

* Driving content to projectors
* Managing looped or triggered playback sequences

**Location**

* Dome PC&#x20;
* Creek PC
* Y PC

**Operational Notes**

*

</details>

***

<details>

<summary>üß≠ NestMap</summary>

**Function**\
Projection mapping tool for aligning visuals across custom surfaces.

**Used For**

* Calibrating and blending visuals across multiple projectors
* Displaying test patterns and mapped content

**Location**

* Dome PC&#x20;
* Creek PC

**Operational Notes**

* Only used if recalibration is needed
* Test pattern should be used to confirm projection accuracy pre-show
* Use in tandem with Resolume via Spout

</details>

<details>

<summary>üîÑ Spout</summary>

**Function**\
Real-time video sharing between applications (e.g. Resolume ‚ûù NestMap).

**Used For**

* Routing live video feed from Resolume into NestMap for mapped display

**Location**

* Runs in the background on the PC

**Operational Notes**

* Requires both Resolume and NestMap to be running
* No user interface ‚Äî verify feed is active by checking mapped projection output
* Restart apps if video fails to display across mapped surfaces

</details>

**1. MadMapper**

* **Function**: Core media server for projection mapping and content delivery.
* **Used For**: Spatial calibration, visual output synchronization, and show integration.
* **Operational Notes**: Requires precise alignment with physical surfaces; ensure hardware (projectors, GPUs) is optimized for low-latency playback.

**2. TouchDesigner**

* **Function**: Real-time interactive content processing and cue triggering.
* **Used For**: Translating user inputs (motion, touch) into dynamic visual responses and environmental storytelling.
* **Operational Notes**: Scripting/network sync with MadMapper critical; test input sensitivity and logic workflows pre-show.

**3. Integrated System (MadMapper + TouchDesigner)**

* **Function**: Synchronized platform for immersive audience engagement.
* **Used For**: Seamless show control, adaptive content playback, and multi-sensory storytelling.
* **Operational Notes**: Regularly validate communication protocols; maintain redundancy for critical cues to ensure uninterrupted performance
