Step-by-Step Cleaning Guide:

Remove the Right-Hand Side Panel:

* Using the Phillips head screwdriver, remove the six black screws from the right-hand side panel (when facing the projector front-on).
* Carefully detach the side panel and set it aside.\


Access the Left-Hand Side:

* On the left-hand side, remove the bottom three screws, leaving the top three screws in place.\


Remove the Bottom Plate:

* Remove all screws from the bottom panel.
* Gently remove the bottom plate to expose the internal components.\


Detach the Front Panel:

* With the underside visible, locate and remove the screws securing the front panel.
* Carefully remove the front panel, noting that there is a clip on the top that may require gentle pressure to release.\


Clean the Panels:

* Take the removed front and side panels outside or to a well-ventilated area.
* Use the air gun to blow off any dust and debris from the panels.
* Wipe the panels with a microfibre cloth to remove any remaining dust particles.



Reassemble the Projector:

* Reattach the front panel, ensuring the top clip is securely fastened.
* Replace the bottom plate and secure it with the screws.
* Reinsert the three screws on the left-hand side.
* Reattach the right-hand side panel with the six screws.\


Additional Tips:

* Avoid using chemical cleaners or solvents, as they may damage the projector's surfaces.
* Do not attempt to clean the internal optical components unless you are trained to do so, as improper handling can cause damage.
* Regularly check and clean the projector's air filters, if applicable, to maintain proper airflow and cooling.
