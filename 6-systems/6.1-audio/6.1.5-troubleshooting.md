# 6.1.5 / Troubleshooting

**ISSUE**: No sound coming out of speakers

Trouble Shooting Steps&#x20;

1. Check the show is unmuted
2. &#x20;  Check the input and output in Audio Status
3. &#x20;  Check the Power button in Audio Status is BLUE

Diagnostic Steps

1. Check the Audio Server 1 & 2 Max 8 interfaces to ensure speakers are receiving signal (The Speaker Should be Highlighted Red)
2. Is the problem localised to a Single Speaker/Room or is the problem occurring over an entire Pavilion/Venue
3. **MAC Sound Card Configuration**
   * **Audio Servers 1 & 2**: Use _CORE AUDIO_ driver with _Dante Virtual Sound Card_ as input/output devices.
   * **Show File Verification**: Ensure the correct Max 8 show file (indicated by desktop icon) is active. In the Matrix window, confirm the show is outputting (not paused/muted).
   * Check the show is unmuted
   * Check the Power button in Audio Status is BLUE
4. **Amplifier & Network Checks**
   * **Amplifiers**: Verify all units (Yamaha XMV4280 4-channel and XMV8140 8-channel) are powered on and visible in _Dante Controller_. Missing units indicate power/connection issues.
   * **Network**:
     * Confirm Cat 6 cabling and switch connections via indicator signals.
     * Use _UNIFI Site Manager_ to diagnose network issues under **VLAN 09 (DANTE 112)** in "All Ports" for full Dante switch visibility.
5. **Physical Amplifier Inspection**
   * Check front panel labels on Yamaha APMs for speaker count, room routing, and model details when troubleshooting signal levels.
6. **Weekly System Shutdown**
   * Power off Mac hardware/software weekly to clear cache, reinitialize configurations, and ensure system stability.
7. U**pdates.**&#x20;

* It is recommended that the following configurations on both Mac Audio servers running macOS Sonoma 14.6—specifically Max 8 and Dante Controller—remain unchanged

All updates to these systems must be authorized exclusively by Nick and carried out solely on an as-needed basis.&#x20;

**Key Tools**: Dante Controller, UNIFI Site Manager, Max 8 Matrix window.\
**Focus Areas**: Show file status, Dante device recognition, VLAN configuration, amplifier connectivity.
