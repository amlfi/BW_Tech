2. &#x20;  Check the input and output in Audio Status
3. &#x20;  Check the Power button in Audio Status is BLUE

Diagnostic Steps

1. Check the Audio Server 1 & 2 Max 8 interfaces to ensure speakers are receiving signal (The Speaker Should be Highlighted Red)
2. Is the problem localised to a Single Speaker/Room or is the problem occurring over an entire Pavilion/Venue
