# 6.1.4.1.5 / Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>No Amplifiers Detected in Dante Controller</summary>

**Symptoms**:

* Amplifiers (Yamaha XMV4280/XMV8140) are powered on but not visible in Dante Controller.
* No audio output to speakers.

**Possible Causes**:

* Amplifier power or network cable failure.
* VLAN misconfiguration (e.g., incorrect VLAN 09 assignment).
* Faulty switch port or Cat 6 cable.

**Steps to Resolve**:

1. Verify amplifier power status and physical connections.
2. Check **UNIFI Site Manager** to confirm VLAN 09 is active and assigned to the correct ports.
3. Re-seat cables or test with a known-working cable/switch port.

<summary> Audio Dropouts or Distortion</summary>

**Symptoms**:

* Intermittent audio cuts, crackling, or latency.

**Possible Causes**:

* Network congestion or packet loss (e.g., non-Dante traffic on VLAN 09).
* Damaged Cat 6 cables or improper clocking.
* Overloaded amplifier channels.

**Steps to Resolve**:

1. Use **Dante Controller** to check network latency and clock synchronization status.
2. Inspect cables for damage and ensure switches prioritize Dante traffic.
3. Verify amplifier load (speaker impedance) matches Yamaha specifications.

<summary>3. Max 8 Show File Not Outputting Audio</summary>

**Symptoms**:

* Show file is active in Max 8, but no sound reaches speakers.

**Possible Causes**:

* Show file is paused/muted in the **Matrix window**.
* Incorrect routing in Dante Controller (e.g., channels not patched).
* Amplifier input or output mapping errors.

**Steps to Resolve**:

1. Open the Max 8 **Matrix window** and confirm the show is actively outputting (not muted).
2. Check Dante Controller routing to ensure audio paths are connected to amplifiers.
3. Test with a simple audio signal (e.g., test tone) to isolate the issue.
