  flown elements in use. All truss, hardware, and overhead equipment remain
  fixed during normal operations.

# 6.5.3 / Operation

### **No Daily Actions Required**

Once installed and certified, the rigging infrastructure does not require routine interaction from the daily technical team.

### **Visual Awareness Only**

Crew should remain aware of the overhead environment during any venue activity, reporting any unexpected movement, visible strain, or contact with overhead structures.

### **Scissor Lift Use for Adjacent Tasks**

When lifts or access gear are used for lighting or AV maintenance, crew must follow all rigging zone restrictions and avoid placing load or pressure on static rigging components.
