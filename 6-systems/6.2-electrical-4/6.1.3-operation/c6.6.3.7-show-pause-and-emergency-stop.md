### üîá Muting Show Audio

* Mute All ‚Äì mutes all show audio
* Unmute ‚Äì resumes audio
* Announce ‚Äì enables PA mic

> **Audio auto-mutes if emergency stop triggered (manual or fire panel). Must unmute manually.**

***

### ‚è∏ Pausing in Show Environment

{% hint style="info" %}
#### We have two types of pauses at Bluey's World; room pause and show pause. Both systems are designed to pause in place the relevant rooms and resume once instructed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Room Pausing Pre Chattermax:

* Pauses the selected room and all **preceding** rooms for relevant side of house
* Useful to prevent guest overlap
* Resume in reverse order on all active rooms

**Room Pausing Post Chattermax:**

* Will pause all preceding rooms including both sides of the house

#### Show Pausing:

* Via Emergency Panel: **Pause Whole Show**
* Plays ‚ÄúGrannies‚Äù loop
* Does NOT affect Foyer/Neighbourhood
* Once issue is resolved, "**Resume Whole Show**" triggers a 5-second audio clip then resumes show

***

### üõë Emergency Stop

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Use in critical situations only.**
{% endhint %}

#### 2 Trigger Methods:

1. **Manual** ‚Äì via iPad Emergency Panel
2. **Fire Panel** ‚Äì auto-triggers stop + emergency lighting

Both triggers stop all show sequences, mutes audio and enables emergency lighting.

#### **Manual Trigger**

Activated by red **FULL SHOW STOP** button.

**Fire Panel Trigger**

Show emergency stop activated by a closed loop triggered from the Fire Panel.&#x20;

When the fire panel detects hazard and is set into alarm mode, the Emergency system automatically triggers the technical show stop. Fire Alarms will also sound on their own speaker system.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important:**\
Follow technical emergency procedures strictly. Emergency stop should be used only in emergency, and not to end the show at EOD.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

***

### üîÅ Resuming a Show

After an Emergency Stop:

* Run reactivation sequences
