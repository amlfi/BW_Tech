3. If it's working, you should see a **faint red light** on the remote through the camera.
   * ‚úÖ If you see the red light ‚Äî the remote is sending a signal.
   * ‚ùå If you **don‚Äôt see any light**, continue to Step 2.

* Try using the **buttons on the TV itself** (if it has any).
* If the TV doesn‚Äôt respond, the issue might be with the **TV, not the remote**.
