## 📷 SADP Camera Setup Guide

This guide walks you through the process of setting up a new camera using the SADP tool. It's tailored for users working from the Tech Office Computer, which is pre-connected to the Security VLAN.

***

### 🛠 Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Launch SADP Tool

* Open the SADP Tool from the desktop or start menu.
* The tool will automatically scan the network for connected Hikvision devices.

***

#### 2. Find the New Camera

* In the SADP interface, locate Status column and look for the device showing Inactive.
* This indicates a new, uninitialized camera.

***

#### 3. Activate the Camera

* Click checkbox on the Inactive camera row to highlight it
* On the right-hand panel, you will see a section prompting you to create a password.

**🔐 Set the Password:**

* Use the standard password listed in Airtable under “HIK Vision Camera’s” Password
* Enter the password in the required fields.
* Click Activate.

***

#### 4. Skip Security Questions (If Prompted)

* If a window appears asking you to set security questions, navigate to the bottom-right and click Skip.

***

#### 5. Enable DHCP

* Still on the right-hand panel, find and tick the checkbox for “Enable DHCP”.
* You will have to re-enter the password, then click Modify.

***

#### 6. Wait for IP Assignment

* After about a minute, the camera will be automatically assigned a new IP address in the format:\
  10.150.95.XXX

***

#### 7. Final Configuration

* Open Google Chrome.
* In the address bar, type the camera’s new IP address (e.g., 10.150.95.108) and press Enter.
* This will take you to the camera’s web interface where you can complete the configuration.

***

### 💡 Notes

* If the camera does not appear in SADP, confirm it's powered and physically connected to the correct network switch.
* The IP format 10.150.95.XXX confirms the camera is on the correct subnet.

If multiple cameras are being configured at once, activate them one at a time to avoid IP conflicts.
