🎥 How to Set Up OBS Stream for NX Witness Viewing

***

#### ✅ Step 1: Check Show Touch Is Running

* On the Show Control computer (in the Control Room):
* Make sure Show Touch is open.
* It should be displaying the “BOH View” panel.

***

#### ✅ Step 2: Launch OBS

* Open OBS Studio from the desktop.
* Ideally, the stream should begin automatically.
* If it doesn’t, follow the steps below to configure it manually.

***

#### ✅ Step 3: Select the Correct Window Source

* In the OBS window, find the center section where the preview window is located.
* Under “Sources”, look for the source linked to Show Touch.
* Click the dropdown menu next to “Window”.
* Select:\
  ➤ \[ShowTouch.exe]: Touch Viewer - Run

***

#### ✅ Step 4: Make Sure Show Touch is Visible

* The Show Touch panel must be open in windowed mode.
* If it’s minimised, the OBS feed will pause — so don’t minimise it.
* You can drag the Show Touch window off to the side (partially off-screen) to keep it out of the way.

***

#### ✅ Step 5: Resize the Viewing Area in OBS

* Click on the Show Touch preview in OBS.
* A red outline will appear around the source.
* Drag the edges to stretch or resize the viewing window until it fits properly.
* If the red outline disappears, try dragging the entire preview window slightly — it will reappear.\


📝 Tip: Changing the size of the actual Show Touch window will also affect how it appears in OBS. Adjust only if needed.

***

#### ✅ Step 6: Start RTSP Streaming

* In OBS, go to the Tools menu at the top.
* Click on “RTSP Server”.
* In the pop-up window, check that the Start button is greyed out.
* If it’s greyed out, it means the stream is active and ready for NX Witness to receive.

***

#### ✅ Step 7: Return Show Touch to Centre of Screen

* Once setup is complete, move the Show Touch window back to the centre of the screen.
* Make sure that all important elements (especially numbers) are fully visible.
* Anything that is off-screen will not appear in the stream, even if OBS appears to show it.
* Double-check that no part of the window is cut off or hidden behind the screen edge.
