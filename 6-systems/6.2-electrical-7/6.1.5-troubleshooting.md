#### 📷 Fixing “Camera Offline” in NX Witness (Made Easy)

If a camera shows “Offline” in NX Witness, follow these simple steps to check the connection:

***

#### 🛠 Step 1: Get the Camera’s IP Address

1. **Open NX Witness** on your computer.
2. **Right-click** on the camera that says **Offline**.
3. Click on **Camera Settings**.
4. Find and **copy the IP Address** shown there. You'll need it for the next steps.

***

#### 🌐 Step 2: Log In to the Network System (Unifi)

1. **Open Google Chrome** (or any browser).
2. **Log in to Unifi** (your network control panel).
3. Once you're in:
   * Click on **Blueys World Site** (on the left side).
   * Then click **Client Devices**.

***

#### 🔍 Step 3: Find the Camera on the Network

1. In the **search bar**, paste the **IP address** from NX Witness.
2. You should see the camera listed.

***

#### ⚓ Step 4: Check What It’s Connected To

1. Click the camera in the search results.
2. A pop-up will appear.
3. Look for **“Connected to”** next to the device picture.
4. **Hover over the link** to see which **port** it’s plugged into.

***

#### 🔌 Step 5: Check the Port Settings

1. Click the **link** showing the port number.
2. Click **Port Manager**.
3. Select the correct **port** from earlier.
4. Make sure the port is set to:
   * **VLAN 07 - Security (80) (7)**

***

#### ✅ Step 6: Make Sure the Camera is Detected

* The port should show a **yellow-ish color**, with the **camera name and logo** above it.

***

#### 🧯 Step 7: If the Camera Still Isn’t Showing

* If you **don’t see the name or logo**, the camera may not be physically connected.
* **Check the cable** between the camera and the switch.
  * Make sure it’s not unplugged, damaged, or in the wrong port.
* Fix the cable and **try again** from Step 3.

***

#### 🔁 Step 8: Power Cycle the Port (Final Fix)

If everything looks connected but the camera **still won’t come online**:

1. Go back to **Port Manager** in Unifi.
2. Look for the **Power Cycle** button and click it.
3. This will **restart power to the camera** — it takes about 1–2 minutes.
4. **Refresh Unifi** after a minute to see if the camera comes online.
