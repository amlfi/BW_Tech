### Implementation Notes

#### Consistent Documentation Structure

Each system section follows a consistent structure to ensure completeness and usability:

1. **System Overview**: Provides a high-level understanding of the system's purpose, components, and role within the venue
2. **System Architecture**: Documents the technical design, signal flow, and integration with other systems
3. **Equipment Inventory**: Catalogs all system components with locations and specifications
4. **Operation Procedures**: Details day-to-day operation including startup, normal use, and shutdown
5. **Passwords and Access**: Manages system access procedures and credential management
6. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Provides diagnostic procedures and solutions for common issues
7. **Maintenance Tasks**: Outlines regular maintenance requirements and procedures
8. **System Documentation**: Collects and indexes technical reference materials

This consistent structure across all systems ensures that technical staff can quickly locate information regardless of which system they are working with.

#### Show Version Management

The structure for "The Show" chapter allows for:

* Documentation of universal show procedures that apply to all versions
* Version-specific information that can be updated as shows change
* Clear documentation of differences between versions
* Transition planning for show version changes

When a new show version is implemented, the previous version's documentation should be archived but remain accessible for reference.
