<summary>Part 1: Getting Your Files Ready</summary>

File Types Supported&#x20;

* STL files: Basic 3D shape files (most common)&#x20;
* 3MF files: Bambu Studio's native format with more information&#x20;
* STEP files: High-accuracy files with assembly information&#x20;

Opening Files&#x20;

1. Download Bambu Studio from bamboo.corn if not already installed&#x20;
2. Open your file by either:&#x20;

* Dragging and dropping the file directly onto the Bambu Studio workspace&#x20;
* Using File ➔ Open to browse for your file&#x20;
* Files can come from downloads, Dropbox, or other storage locations&#x20;

All the complex CAD information (layers, classes, etc.) gets simplified into a basic blob that the printer can understand.&#x20;

<summary>Part 2: Arranging Objects on the Print Bed</summary>

Understanding the Print Plate&#x20;

* The virtual "plate" in Bambu Studio represents your physical print bed&#x20;
* Objects must be positioned properly to print successfully&#x20;
* We use smooth plates (not textured plates) in our setup&#x20;

Positioning Your Objects&#x20;

1. Auto-Arrange Feature:&#x20;

* Click the auto-arrange button to let Bambu Studio position objects automatically&#x20;
* This optimizes printing time by reducing travel distances for the print head&#x20;

2. Manual Positioning:&#x20;

* Drag objects around the plate as needed&#x20;
* Critical Rule: Objects must have maximum surface area touching the print bed&#x20;
* The bottom surface touching the plate will be smooth and nice&#x20;
* The top surface will be more detailed but may need sanding&#x20;

3. Spacing Objects:&#x20;

* Leave space between objects (don't place them too close together)&#x20;
* This prevents support material from different objects from interfering with each other&#x20;
* Extra space allows for proper printing of adhesion helpers (brims, skirts)&#x20;

Object Orientation&#x20;

* Always ensure objects sit flat on the plate&#x20;
* Use the "Lay Flat" button if an object isn't sitting properly on the bed&#x20;
* Golden Rule: If you rotate an object 90° and there's nothing underneath it partway through the print, it will fail&#x20;
* Each layer must have something to sit on top of the previous layer&#x20;

<summary>Part 3: Understanding Support Material</summary>

What is Support Material?&#x20;

Support material is temporary structure that holds up overhanging parts of your print.&#x20;

Types of Support&#x20;

1. Basic Support:&#x20;

* Tower-like structures&#x20;
* Good when there's a straight line down from the overhang&#x20;
* Uses more material&#x20;

2. Tree Support: (Recommended)&#x20;

* Branching tree-like structures&#x20;
* Better for complex overhangs (like under a nose that doesn't align vertically)&#x20;

- Uses less material&#x20;
- Easier to remove after printing&#x20;

Managing Support Settings&#x20;

1. Go to the Support tab&#x20;
2. Enable Support if needed&#x20;
3. Choose Tree Support for most situations&#x20;
4. Use the Paint Tool to customize support:&#x20;
5. Block out areas where you don't want support&#x20;
6. Add support to specific areas that need it&#x20;
7. This reduces waste and makes clean-up easier&#x20;

<summary>Part 4: Slicing Your Model </summary>

What is Slicing?&#x20;

Slicing converts your 3D model into individual layers with specific instructions for the printer, creating G-Code toolpath commands. The software calculates exactly where the print head needs to move for each layer.&#x20;

Slicing Process&#x20;

1. Click the "Slice" button (may take several minutes for complex models)&#x20;
2. Review the preview to see how your object will print layer by layer&#x20;
3. Check support placement - you'll see the tree or basic support structures&#x20;
4. Verify settings before proceeding

<summary>Part 5: Selecting Your Printer and Materials</summary>

Printer Selection&#x20;

Our tech office has 3 printers identified as:&#x20;

* Left printer&#x20;
* Middle printer&#x20;
* Right printer&#x20;



1. Go to the Device tab&#x20;
2. Select your target printer from the list&#x20;
3. Verify the printer is online and ready&#x20;

Material Selection&#x20;

1. Check what filament is loaded in your chosen printer&#x20;
2. Common materials we use:&#x20;

* PETG: Sturdy, slightly more expensive, good for functional parts&#x20;
* PLA: Basic filament, cheaper, good for prototypes&#x20;

3. Verify the material in Bambu Studio matches what's loaded in the printer&#x20;

Print Settings Verification&#x20;

* Plate Type: Confirm "Smooth Plate" is selected (we don't use textured plates)&#x20;
* Nozzle Size: Usually 0.4mm&#x20;
* Print Quality: Settings are usually pre-configured correctly&#x20;

<summary>Part 6: Sending to Printer</summary>

Pre-Print Checklist&#x20;

1. File is sliced successfully&#x20;
2. Printer is selected and online&#x20;
3. Correct filament type is selected in software&#x20;
4. Filament is actually loaded in the physical printer  Print bed is clean and ready&#x20;

Sending the File&#x20;

1. Click "Print" after slicing is complete&#x20;
2. Select your specific printer from the device list&#x20;
3. Confirm filament selection matches what's loaded&#x20;
4. Review print time and material usage&#x20;

* Example: 32m of filament, 7-8 hours print time&#x20;

5. Click "Send" to transfer the file&#x20;

Transfer Methods&#x20;

Files transfer directly to the printer when Bambu Studio finds the printer on the local network and an SD card is present. Otherwise, files transfer via cloud to the printer.&#x20;

<summary>Part 7: Print Management and Monitoring</summary>

Starting the Print

1. Printer will warm up - this takes a few minutes&#x20;
2. First layer is critical - the printer will:&#x20;

* Print primes and skirts around your object&#x20;
* Ensure proper bed adhesion&#x20;
* Create a solid foundation&#x20;

What to Watch For&#x20;

* First layer must stick properly - if it moves, the print will fail&#x20;
* No spaghetti printing - if layers aren't adhering, stop the print&#x20;
* Monitor for clashing support structures&#x20;

During Long Prints&#x20;

* Prints can take many hours (7-8+ hours is common)&#x20;
* Check periodically but don't interfere unnecessarily&#x20;
* Trust the process - modern printers are quite reliable&#x20;

<summary>Part 8: Troubleshooting Common Issues</summary>

File Won't Open&#x20;

* Check file format (STL, 3MF, STEP)&#x20;
* Ensure Dropbox/storage drive isn't full&#x20;
* Try dragging and dropping instead of using File menu&#x20;

Objects Won't Slice Properly&#x20;

* Check object orientation (must sit flat on bed)&#x20;
* Verify support is enabled for overhangs&#x20;
* Make sure objects aren't overlapping&#x20;

Printer Not Found&#x20;

* Check network connection&#x20;
* Verify printer is powered on and ready&#x20;
* Make sure SD card is inserted in printer&#x20;

Print Failing&#x20;

* First layer problems: Clean print bed, check bed leveling&#x20;
* Support issues: Adjust support settings or add manual supp
* Warping: Ensure proper bed adhesion and material settings&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Part 9: Post-Processing</summary>

Removing Prints&#x20;

* Wait for bed to cool before removing prints&#x20;
* Use appropriate tools to safely remove objects&#x20;
* Clean print bed for next use&#x20;

Support Removal&#x20;

* Tree supports snap off relatively easily&#x20;
* Basic supports may require more effort&#x20;
* Sand surfaces as needed for final finish&#x20;

File Management&#x20;

* Save your sliced files for reprinting&#x20;
* Keep original STL/3MF files organized&#x20;
* Document successful print settings for future reference&#x20;
