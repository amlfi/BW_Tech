# 4.2 / Sensory Show Operation

## What is a Sensory show?

The experience at Bluey's World features dynamic lighting, immersive audio, and busy public areas. These elements may be stimulating for some guests.

Sensory shows are sessions that run with reduced capacity and stimuli, to accommodate patrons with sensory sensitivities (e.g., autistic guests, PTSD, or sensory processing disorders).&#x20;

In operations, we refer to these as "Relaxed" shows, and this naming convention can be found used in ShowTouch Operations Centre.
